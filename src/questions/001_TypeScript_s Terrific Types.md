## Context

### Question
Which of the following is NOT a basic type in TypeScript?

## Answers
- `number`
- `string`
- `float`
- `boolean`

## Explanation
In TypeScript, `float` is not a basic type. The basic types include `number` (which covers both integers and floating-point numbers), `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`, `symbol`, and `bigint`. TypeScript uses `number` for all numeric values, whether they are integers or floating-point numbers.

## Hint
Think about how JavaScript handles numeric types.
