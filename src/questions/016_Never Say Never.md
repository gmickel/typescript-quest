## Context

### Question
In which scenario is the `never` type most appropriately used?

## Answers
- To represent null or undefined values
- To represent any possible value
- To represent boolean values
- To represent a function that never returns or always throws an error

## Explanation
The correct answer is to represent a function that never returns or always throws an error. The `never` type in TypeScript represents the type of values that never occur. It's often used as the return type for functions that always throw exceptions or never terminate. It's also the type of an empty union (a union with no members).

## Hint
Think about what "never" might imply in the context of a function's behavior.
