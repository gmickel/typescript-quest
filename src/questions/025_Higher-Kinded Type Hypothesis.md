## Context

### Question
TypeScript doesn't natively support higher-kinded types, but they can be simulated. What is the primary use case for higher-kinded types?

## Answers
- To abstract over type constructors
- To implement multiple inheritance
- To create self-referential types
- To enforce nominal typing

## Explanation
The correct answer is to abstract over type constructors. Higher-kinded types allow you to write generic code that works with type constructors (types that take other types as parameters) in a flexible way. While TypeScript doesn't have direct support for higher-kinded types, techniques exist to simulate them. This advanced feature is useful for creating highly abstract and reusable code, especially when working with complex generic libraries or functional programming patterns.

## Hint
Think about how you might want to write code that works with different container types (like arrays, promises, or custom data structures) in a generic way.
