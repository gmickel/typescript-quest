## Context

### Question
What is the primary purpose of namespaces in TypeScript?

## Answers
- To group related functionality and prevent name collisions
- To create private variables and functions
- To define interfaces for classes
- To implement asynchronous programming

## Explanation
The correct answer is to group related functionality and prevent name collisions. Namespaces in TypeScript provide a way to organize code into logical containers, helping to avoid naming conflicts in your codebase. They allow you to group related functions, classes, and variables under a single name, making it easier to manage large codebases and prevent naming clashes between different parts of your code.

## Hint
Think about how namespaces might help in organizing large codebases with many functions and variables.
